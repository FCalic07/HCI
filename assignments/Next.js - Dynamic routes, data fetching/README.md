# Next.js - Dynamic routes, data fetching

## **Assignment Details**

### **Dynamic Routes**

Utilize Next to create [**dynamic routes**](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) for blog posts (or alternatively your own resources like products). Implement dynamic routing to handle posts or products index page and individual posts/product pages.

### **Server-Side Data Fetching**

Integrate [**JSONPlaceholder**](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), a free online REST API, to fetch fake product data dynamically. Alternatively, use your own REST API server. Read product information from JSONPlaceholder and populate the blog pages with realistic fake data. **Try to implement pagination (o*ptional, for more experienced*).

## Our work

We’re fetching /users data from the JSONPlaceholder API to create a “trusted partners” page in About Us and then implement dynamic individual partners pages, showcasing more information about them.
