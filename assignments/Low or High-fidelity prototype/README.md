# Low/High-fidelity prototype

## **Assignment Details**

Utilizing Figma, design either a low or high-fidelity prototype for the landing/home page of your web application. Do make use of ChatGPT for your project to speed this task up. Provide it with some context: personas, sitemap, description, developed in the previous assignments. Then ask ChatGPT to propose design requirements and content outline for your page.

## Our work

We’ve developed high-fidelity prototypes of our website's homepage, designed for both desktop and mobile versions.

Based on our initial design (images tagged with -v1) ChatGPT gave us a review and according to that we updated the design.

Top 3 ChatGPT’s recommendations were:

- Make the subheading ("INCREASE YOUR PRODUCTIVITY WITH OUR SERVICE") slightly larger or give it more contrast to improve visibility
- In the About Us section the text and image pairing works well visually. However, consider aligning the image and text a bit closer together to reduce white space.
- The cards are neatly aligned with good use of images and "Learn More" buttons. However, the descriptions beneath each image could use better differentiation (e.g., a smaller font size or a different color). And for the mobile version the vertical stacking of cards is effective, but the spacing between them could be reduced slightly to avoid excessive scrolling.
